# Object methods and operations
##ss Mutable
The mutable objects are objects whose value can be changed after initialization. We can change the object's values, such as field and states, after the object is created. For example, Java.util.Date, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, etc.

The Getters and Setters ( get() and set() methods ) are available in mutable objects. The Mutable object may or may not be thread-safe.

## Immutable
The immutable objects are objects whose value can not be changed after initialization. We can not change anything once the object is created. For example, primitive objects such as int, long, float, double, all legacy classes, Wrapper class, String class, etc.

In a nutshell, immutable means unmodified or unchangeable. Once the immutable objects are created, its object values and state can not be changed.

Only Getters ( get() method) are available not Setters ( set() method) for immutable objects.
