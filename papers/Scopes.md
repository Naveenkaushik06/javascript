# Scopes
A SCOPE document is one of those fundamental documents that define and guide any major project.

In terms of its strategic abstraction, the SCOPE comes right after the VISION document.

The VISION document expresses what the company/project ideally and ultimately tries to accomplish, if no limits (time, staff, finances, technology, etc.) were involved.

The SCOPE document is all about realistic limits, boundaries, and how to achieve the project’s goals despite such limitations.

SCOPE documents differ widely from one project to another. But in its most general outlines, here are its 6 major components:

1)Introduction and definition of project’s goal. List of deliverables.

2)Business rationale and the justification of the project.

3)List of stakeholders and their rights, duties, and responsibilities.

4)List of resources, their availability and limiting factors.

5)Time table for deliverables.

6)Risk analysis and management.
